      <h2>Step 6: Attend Orientation (Transitioning)</h2>
      <p> The Nursery school supports children's transition into the school by	giving	the	child	and	parent(s) an	
        opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet	the	teachers	and	classmates.	</p>
      <p> This one-hour visit provides an opportunity for children to engage in free play while parents receive a brief overview of what to expect during the school year. The 
        day following orientation, children attend school independently, either on Wednesday or Thursday (refer to the orientation 
        schedule). Classes are divided into two groups, with each group attending on either Wednesday or Thursday, allowing for small 
        group interactions before the entire class convenes on Friday.</p>
