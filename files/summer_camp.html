          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            Designed for children ages two and a half to five years, our summer
            camp program includes a wide range of creative indoor and outdoor
            activities, with time to explore and discover, play and make
            friends. Since a good number of hours are spent outside during
            summer camp, the nursery school playground provides opportunities to
            cool off with outdoor water play that includes troughs, sprinklers
            and hoses. Building in the sand and playing on the climbing
            equipment are two other favorite outdoor activities. An adjoining
            wading pool is available for summer campers, whether enrolled in the
            swimming classes or not. Children bring their own lunches. Camp
            provides a morning snack.
          </p>
          <p>
            3-Bears Camp is located in the Washington University Nursery School
            facility on the Washington University campus. It is composed of three
            classrooms and an all-purpose room, which are designed to offer
            children a variety of choices in their play. Our large outdoor play
            area gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide,
            and play in the sand and water.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children may take advantage of swimming lessons offered as an optional
            program during each session. There will be eight lessons per session,
            at a cost of $65. Children must be toilet trained to participate in
            swimming lessons. The swimming pool is located adjacent to the Nursery
            School.
