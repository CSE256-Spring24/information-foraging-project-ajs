      <button class="accordion">Conference - How the School Assess Children’s Knowledge, Support Growth, and Share Results with Parents</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
          conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers
          keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
          development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
          writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
          in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	
          </p>
        <p>The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an
          informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a	
          more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any	
          time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Families receive updates on current themes, activities, and upcoming events via newsletters, the school website, and emails.</li>
                    <li>Classroom teachers often initiate phone calls or emails to discuss children's adjustment, observations, or concerns.</li>
                    <li>If there's a need to speak directly with a teacher or the director, families are encouraged to reach out to the office via email or phone.</li>
                    <li>Additionally, teachers remain available for communication after the school day ends, reachable via phone or email.</li>

      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>The	staff	and	director	at	WUNS	work	to	maintain	a	very	positive	and	nurturing	environment	
          for	each	child.		Classroom	limits	are	necessary	to	provide	a	sense	of	order	and	allow	teachers 
          to	spend	as	much	time	as	possible	providing	a	stimulating	environment	for	each	child.		Our	
          rule	of	thumb	is	that	children	keep	themselves	safe,	keep	friends	safe,	and	the	toys	at	school	
          safe.</p>
        <p>The	staff	is	trained	to	anticipate	potentially	problematic	situations;	they	remind	children	of
            appropriate	behavior	and	redirect	or	intervene	when	necessary.		In	most	cases,	teachers	can
            stop	or	re-direct	behavior	before	something	negative	occurs.		If	not,	teachers	will	first	consult
            the	injured	party	to	make	sure	they	are	emotionally	and	physically	okay.		Then,	they	will	turn 
            their	attention	to	the	child	who	might	need	more	support	in	“keeping	their	friends	safe”	or, 
            more	likely,	“keeping	their	bodies	safe”	with	others.		Reflection	over	what	has	occurred	will
            lead	to	discovering	other	behavior	options	and	resolving	things	with	the	peer.</p>
          <p>Encouragement	and	pride	in	self	is	the	basis	of	our	discipline	policy.	Our	aim	is	to	have	the	
          children	manage	their	own	actions	and	reactions.	The	teachers	and	staff	will	help	children 
          learn	and	develop	skills	that	they	need	to	display	appropriate	behavior.			This	is	done 
          through:
          </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Positive	reinforcement.</li>
            <li>Anticipating	unhealthy	social	interaction.</li>
            <li>Re-direction:		guiding	a	child	toward	appropriate,	socially	positive	activities.</li>
            <li>Naming	and	validating	child’s	feelings</li>
            <li>Expressing	disappointment	or	disapproval	in a	respectful	and	constructive	manner</li>
            <li>Simple,	logical	and	immediate	consequences.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When	inappropriate	behavior	is	a	continuing	problem, the	school	will	work	with	parents	to	
          understand	the	issue	and	make	appropriate	recommendations.		It	is	our	goal	to	make	school	
          a	positive,	rewarding	and	enjoyable	experience	for	each	child.		We	realize, however,	that	we	
          cannot	meet	the	needs	of	all	children	and	parents.		If	it	is	determined	that	a	child	is	not	
          growing	from	his/her	preschool	experience	at	the	Nursery	School, a	discussion	will	be	held	
          with	parents	at	which	it	may	be	decided	that	this	program	is	not	appropriate	for	the	child.		
          The	director	and	teachers	will	make	recommendations	of	other	preschool	programs	and	
          relevant	community	services	if	parents	so	desire.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Extra Help - How the School Provides Extra Help to Students Who Need it</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include:

          Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking process, build trust, and increase student confidence
          Offering more opportunities for exploration
          Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli
          Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration
          Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process
          Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular concept, skill, or area of concern</p>
